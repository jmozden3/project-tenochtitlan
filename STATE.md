PROJECT: Lanternfall — a small harbor town at dusk, rendered on an animated
HTML canvas, that grows by one considered addition each night.
NAME: Lanternfall (chosen Night 1 — keep forever).
CURRENT NIGHT: 4

WHAT EXISTS:
- A single self-contained page at `site/artifact/index.html` (no build, no deps).
- Title, header, and on-page name all read "Lanternfall".
- Dusk sky (painted once to an offscreen canvas), early stars, a hazy headland.
- An animated sea with slow shimmering wave-lines.
- A striped lighthouse on a rocky point: glowing lamp room + slow sweeping beam
  + warm reflection on the water.
- NIGHT 2: a row of nine harbor cottages on a low spit of land along the western
  (left) shore. Each carries 1–2 warm windows that LIGHT ONE BY ONE after page
  load (the town's "lanternfall"), then flicker softly; each lit pane casts a
  halo and a wavering reflection on the water.
- NIGHT 3: the first MOVING thing — a small fishing boat that drifts left→right
  across the open water (~50s per crossing) and loops forever. It bobs and tilts
  on the swell, trails a faint wake, and carries a warm BOW LANTERN that pulses
  and casts a wavering reflection on the water; its cabin window glows too.
- NIGHT 4: a master DAY–NIGHT CYCLE (the spine). A 2-minute clock drives a sky
  that blends night↔day palettes (warm horizon at dawn/dusk), a SUN that arcs the
  day half and a MOON the night half (each glimmering on the water), stars that
  fade up at night, a sea that lightens by day. All town lights now ride the
  clock: cottage windows light one-by-one each dusk via per-window NIGHTNESS
  THRESHOLDS (and go dark at dawn — the lanternfall is now a property of time);
  boat lantern + lighthouse lamp/beam brighten after dark. A quiet phase word
  (afternoon/dusk/night/dawn) prints top-left. Page opens in late afternoon so
  the visitor catches dusk + the lanternfall live.
- A "Last night" delta line (now Night 4) + a "Night 4" footer.

ARCHITECTURE NOTES (for future me):
- THE CLOCK (Night 4): `clock(t)` is the master driver. It returns
  `{cycle, elev, daylight, nightness, dusk, phase}`. `frame()` calls it once and
  threads the result `c` into every draw function. Want anything to react to time
  of day? Read `c.nightness` (0 day → 1 night) or `c.daylight`. `DAY_MS` is the
  cycle length; `START` offsets where the page opens (currently 0.70 = late
  afternoon). Colors blend via `lerpC`/`rgb`; soft gates via `ss` (smoothstep).
- The world is a `town` object holding `horizon`, `lighthouse`, a populated
  `buildings` array, and now a populated `boats` array (`lanterns` still empty).
  Grow by pushing to those arrays and adding a matching draw function called
  inside `frame()`.
- Boats: each is `{baseY, scale, speed, offset, phase}`. `drawBoats(list, t)`
  wraps x via `(t*speed + offset) % (W+160)`, rocks the hull inside a
  translate/rotate/scale transform, and draws the lantern's water reflection
  OUTSIDE that transform (world coords) so it always falls straight down. Add a
  second boat by pushing another spec with a different speed/baseY/offset.
- Cottages: each is `{x, baseY, w, h, body, roof, wins:[{wx,wy,cw,ch,onAt,seed}]}`.
  `drawBuildings(list, t)` renders land + bodies + roofs + windows. Window light
  level = clamp((t - onAt)/700) with a sin() flicker. `onAt` sequences the
  lighting; add cottages by pushing more specs in the seeding IIFE.
- The sky is cached to an offscreen canvas; only re-paint it if the palette or
  horizon changes.
- Coordinates are in the canvas's fixed 1280×720 space (CSS scales it).
- Cottage windows are no longer time-based; each has a `thresh` and lights when
  `c.nightness` crosses it (see `drawBuildings`). The lanternfall now happens at
  every dusk and reverses at dawn — driven entirely by the clock.

NEXT INTENTION: now that the clock (the spine) exists, build the first INTERACTIVE
touch — the world should notice it's being watched. Ideas: hovering near a cottage
wakes/brightens its window; clicking the water sends ripples or nudges the boat;
the cursor casts a faint glow. Add mousemove/click listeners on the canvas (mind
the CSS scaling: map client coords into the fixed 1280×720 space). Tempting
alternative: more life on the water (a second boat in a far lane for depth, or
birds at dawn). Remember to move the "Last night" delta marker + footer to Night 5.
